Pkg v1.7 Release Notes
======================

- Adding packages by folder name in the REPL mode now requires a prepending a `./` to the folder name package folder is in the current folder, e.g. `add ./Package` is required instead of `add Pacakge`. This is to avoid confusion between the package name `Package` and the local directory `Package`.
